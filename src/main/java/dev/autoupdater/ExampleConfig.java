            # mode
            #   hosted-safe:
            #     Recommended for hosted panels and normal servers.
            #     Downloads ready-made jars first. It will only run Git/Gradle/Maven when
            #     buildFromSource.enabled is true/auto and the repo is trusted.
            #   auto:
            #     Allows auto-detection features. In this version, updates still use
            #     hosted/downloaded jars only.
            #
            # onFailure
            #   keep-current:
            #     Recommended. If an update fails and an old jar exists, keep using it.
            #     This helps the server still start when a download site is down.
            #   stop:
            #     Stop startup if a required update cannot be completed.
            #
            # startup rollback
            #   After installing plugin updates, Auto-Updater watches early server console
            #   output for load failures that mention an updated plugin. If one is found,
            #   it restores the previous jar backup, restarts once, and keeps the server on
            #   the last jar that actually loaded. If no previous jar existed, it removes
            #   the failed new jar.
            #
            # selfUpdate
            #   Optional. When enabled, Auto-Updater checks a release/direct jar source for
            #   a replacement auto-updater.jar before normal updates. If it finds one, it
            #   launches a helper, exits, lets the helper swap this jar safely, and then
            #   relaunches the same command when running in run mode.
            #
            # userAgent
            #   Sent to download APIs. PaperMC asks automated clients to include a real
            #   contact string, so replace your-email@example.com.
            #
            # diagnosticsFile
            #   Appended with useful diagnostics, such as GitHub HTTP 403 rate-limit
            #   headers and response bodies.
            #
            # githubToken
            #   Optional. Use env:GITHUB_TOKEN or env:GH_TOKEN to raise GitHub API
            #   limits without storing the token directly in updater.yml.
            #   If the env var is not exported to Java, the updater also checks
            #   .auto-updater.env, .env, and github.token in the server folder.
            #   On startup the updater prints the visible token source and current
            #   GitHub core/search limits without printing the token itself.

            #
            # discovery.sourcePriority
            #   Preferred order when choosing good discovered plugin sources.
            #   Supported source families: github-release, hangar, modrinth.
            #   Spigot/Spiget is intentionally unsupported because its metadata is too
            #   weak for reliable authorship, jar identity, and Folia compatibility checks.
            #
            # discovery.checkAlternateSourcesWhenOutdated
            #   If true, discovery compares version strings where APIs expose them and
            #   rejects sources that look clearly older than the installed plugin jar.
            #
            # discovery.outdatedThresholdDays
            #   How old a source can look before discovery treats it as stale.
            #
            # discovery.autoSwitchSource

            #   automatically for that run, with other strong matches added as fallbacks.
            #   Existing unsupported Spigot primaries are moved to a better proven source
            #   or marked Not Found.
            #
            # discovery.saveDiscoveredSources
            #   If true, auto-switched plugin sources are written back into this config.
            #   Existing plugin entries are patched by installAs/name. Newly scanned plugins
            #   are appended under plugins: with the discovered source and fallbacks.
            #   When no reliable source is found, source is written as "Not Found"; the
            #   updater skips installs for that plugin but retries discovery next run.
            #
            # discovery.scanInstalledPlugins
            #   If true, scans plugins/ for jars that are not already listed.
            #   It can fill name, installAs, platform, and required.
            #   It also searches GitHub, Hangar, and Modrinth for likely update
            #   sources, then prints the best YAML entry it can safely suggest.

            #

            # validation.enabled
            #   true:

            #     the live jar.
            #
            # validation.minAutoInstallScore
            #   Minimum metadata match score for auto-discovered or fallback sources.
            #   90 means only very strong matches install automatically.
            #

            #   Minimum metadata match score for explicitly configured/trusted sources.
            #   85 gives trusted sources a little room for normal metadata changes.
            #

            #   If true, reject a downloaded jar when its plugin.yml/paper-plugin.yml
            #   or velocity-plugin.json says it is clearly a different plugin.
            #
            # validation.rejectOnPluginFingerprintMismatch
            #   If true, reject same-name jars when stronger identity hints disagree,
            #   such as installed authors/main package vs downloaded authors/main package
            #   or a GitHub/Hangar owner that does not match the installed jar author.
            #
            # validation.rejectWrongPlatform
            #   If true, reject wrong-platform jars before install. Example: do not
            #   install a Velocity/Fabric/NeoForge jar into a Folia/Paper plugins folder.
            #   On Folia, it also prevents downgrading support: if the installed jar has
            #   folia-supported: true, a replacement jar must keep that flag.
            #
            # duplicates.enabled

            #
            # duplicates.action
